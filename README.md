# IUHillelApp
An App that I made using React Native and Expo for Indiana University Hillel

Here are the required installs for this app using npm to be properly used as an Expo app:

npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

npx expo install expo-location

npm i react-native-modal-dropdown

npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

npm install firebase
